**Overview**

AbbVie or "the company" refer to AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. AbbVie is a global,
diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership
positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach
to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie was
incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the
distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott\'s shareholders.

**Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities**

AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and
distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand
of products by physicians, external experts and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance
organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, State Medicaid programs,
the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also
markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States many of the company\'s products must be sold pursuant to a
prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its promotional and market access efforts on external experts, payers, physicians and
health systems. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products.

AbbVie\'s products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty
pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic
products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. Although AbbVie\'s business does not have
significant seasonality, AbbVie\'s product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler
inventory levels and other factors.

In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales
directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. In 2024, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc.
and Cencora, Inc.) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie\'s pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. No individual wholesaler
accounted for greater than 39% of AbbVie\'s 2024 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily
to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on
reimbursement terms.

Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost,
would have a material adverse effect on the company\'s business. No material portion of AbbVie\'s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or
termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to
AbbVie\'s business.

**Competition**

The markets for AbbVie\'s products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology
companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products, therapies and biologics. For example, AbbVie\'s
immunology products compete with anti-TNF products, JAK inhibitors and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease
states, and AbbVie\'s oncology products compete with BTK inhibitors and other competitive products intended to treat certain cancers. In
addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently
marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a
significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result
in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products for
branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie\'s products that do not have patent protection. New products or
treatments brought to market by AbbVie’s competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales
volume decreases.

_Biosimilars.  Competition for AbbVie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as “biosimilars.”_
Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or
inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for small molecule medications, and
many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or
for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to
produce biologic products.

Humira faces direct biosimilar competition globally, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from
orally administered products.

In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act
(PHSA) and the regulations implementing these statutes. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a
pathway for approval of biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the
FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is "highly similar" to the original product and has no clinically
meaningful differences from the original product in

-----

terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical
data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies.

Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be "interchangeable" will be considered by the FDA as
substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To
prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same
clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety
risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the
original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted
and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty.

**Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity**

Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory
regimes. AbbVie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all
significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the
filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of
time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product
launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly
known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a “patent term restoration,” for patents
on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of
the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such
compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years
and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly
eligible for terms of patent restoration.

Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and
requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a
conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent
regulatory exclusivity. Specific conditions of use approved for individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval
was based on the FDA’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the
product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory)
related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a
reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan
drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic
Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to
certain exclusivities already provided for by law.

Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled
upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer
available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and
scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of
time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual
case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other
factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the
introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods.

Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as
Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of
12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies.
Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic
and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent

-----

infringement, validity and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published
guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory
scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales
erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products.

AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of
thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the nonUnited States counterparts to these patents and applications.

These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2025 to the mid 2040s, in aggregate are believed to
be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie’s business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related
group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole.

In addition, the following patents, licenses and trademarks are significant: those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark
Skyrizi) and those related to upadacitinib (which is sold under the trademark Rinvoq). The United States composition of matter patents covering
risankizumab and upadacitinib are expected to expire in 2033.

AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product
candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements
may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known
or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie’s employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use
intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and
inventions.

**Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements**

In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-toacquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development
and co-marketing agreements and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and
conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary
terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license
fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, "Licensing,
Acquisitions and Other Arrangements—Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8,
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

**Third Party Agreements**

AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain
products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In
addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and
development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does
not believe that these manufacturing-related agreements are material because AbbVie\'s business is not substantially dependent on any
individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its
manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to
minimize the impact of any supply disruption.

AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, "Licensing, Acquisitions and Other
Arrangements—Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data."

**Sources and Availability of Raw Materials**

AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around
the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated
third party suppliers. AbbVie has robust business continuity and supplier monitoring programs.


-----

**Research and Development Activities**

AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds (and complementary devices) in clinical
development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie\'s ability to discover and develop new compounds is
enhanced by the company\'s use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and
pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other
pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie’s
existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions.

The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has
a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical
development which generally includes the following phases:

   - Phase 1— involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and doses for
later phases.

   - Phase 2— tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to assess efficacy.

   - Phase 3— tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further
demonstrate efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval.

Preclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological
License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The
specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions.

The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The
research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a
molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication.

In addition to the development of new products, delivery devices and new formulations, research and development projects also may
include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional
data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug.

**Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development**

_United States.  Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial_
resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before
commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are
conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are
submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an
NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current
Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).

Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA and other
regulatory authorities, and these inspections associated with clinical development may include the sponsor, investigator sites, laboratories,
hospitals and manufacturing facilities of AbbVie\'s subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory
requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, including rejection of an NDA or BLA.

Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval
must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and
promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and
certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The
FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping
requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor
the product\'s safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or
additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval


-----

regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate
product labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses along with other labeling restrictions.

_Outside the United States.  AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing_
of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory
authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets. The approval requirements and process for each
country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For
example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The
centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single
marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization
application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency. After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the
European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides
for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.

In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japanspecific trials and/or bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients are usually required. After
completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the
application.

Similarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center for Drug Evaluation of the National Medical Products
Administration for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical data in Chinese subjects are usually required to
support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial.

The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require
regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or
complete its regulatory review process. Similar to the requirements in Japan and China, certain countries (notably South Korea, Taiwan, India and
Russia) also generally require that clinical studies that include data from patients in those countries be conducted in order to support local
regulatory approval.

The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations
such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization
has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required
(such as Risk Management Plans).

**Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing**

The manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie\'s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation.
Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses
(among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and
manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing
surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie\'s operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that
limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the
marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate
interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and
regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States.
Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie\'s business. Among other effects, health care regulations
substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing
products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to
ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or
recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product\'s production and sale and other civil or criminal
sanctions, including fines and penalties.

In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie\'s business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of
health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These
studies can lead to updates to the data regarding utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies
have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide,
and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.

Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative
bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs
are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and
containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the
United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage
limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope
and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie\'s products for the foreseeable future.

_United States.  Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state_
Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates may affect
AbbVie\'s business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care
programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United
States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative
changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also
established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various
designated health care entities and facilities.

In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a
different manufacturer\'s generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a
diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a
prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a
health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment,
thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs
based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital
outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under
Part D.

Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care
Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, through the end of 2024 AbbVie provided a
discount of 70% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fell into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or "donut hole."

The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and
biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the
state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring
disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) requires: (i) the government to set prices for select high expenditure Medicare Part D drugs
(prices effective beginning in 2026) and Part B drugs (prices effective beginning in 2028) that are more than nine years (for small-molecule
drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their FDA approval, (ii) manufacturers to pay a rebate for Medicare Part B and Part D drugs when
prices for those drugs increase faster than inflation beginning in 2022 for Part D and 2023 for Part B, and (iii) a Medicare Part D redesign
replacing the current coverage gap provisions and establishing a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2025,
with manufacturers being responsible for 10% of costs up to the $2,000 cap and 20% after that cap is reached. In August 2023, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (the CMS), selected Imbruvica as one of
the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. In August 2024, the CMS published Medicare Part D prices that will be
applicable to these medicines, including Imbruvica, beginning January 1, 2026. In January 2025, HHS, through the CMS, selected Vraylar and
Linzess as two of the 15 medicines subject to government-set prices

beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future
years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. The effect of reducing
prices and reimbursement could significantly impact revenues for certain of our products.

_European Union.  The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply,_
pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union
and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical
product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result,
patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government
either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years,
many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national
pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products.

Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer\'s
generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe
generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments
use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems.

_Japan.  In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible_
for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally
introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful,
that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The
government has also promoted the use of generics, where available.

_Emerging Markets.  Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price_
controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals.

Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local
regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency
exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other
governmental action.

**Regulation – Medical Devices**

Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as
various U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical
device products agencies in the United States. AbbVie’s medical device product candidates, including AbbVie’s breast implants, must undergo
rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other
countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the continuing need for compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may
be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved products and their
manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their
manufacture, sale and/or use or require their withdrawal from the market.

_United States. AbbVie’s medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption_
applies, each medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in
accordance with the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the
degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices
deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as lifesustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device,
are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission
of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of
AbbVie’s medical device products, including AbbVie’s breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices. A


-----

Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval
can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other
regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of AbbVie’s subcontractors or other third-party
manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of
the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of AbbVie’ products; operating
restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing AbbVie’ request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products;
withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution.

A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical
trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be supported by appropriate data,
such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically
sound. A study sponsor must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain approval of its study from the Institutional Review
Board overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device.

Once a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including
Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during
the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their
manufactured devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance
with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious
injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field
correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a
health risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses
along with other labeling restrictions.

_European Union. Medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical_
Device Regulation (the MDR), which came into effect in May 2021. The MDR provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design,
manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European
Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDR are entitled to bear a Conformité Européenne
marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international
regulatory requirements could affect AbbVie’s ability to market and sell AbbVie’s products in these countries.

**Environmental Matters**

AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental
protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment
from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie\'s capital expenditures for pollution control in 2024 were approximately $13 million and operating
expenditures were approximately $35 million. In 2025, capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $15 million
and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $37 million.

Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United
States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a
party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been
transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar
agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie
believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning
environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company\'s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

**Employees**

AbbVie employed approximately 55,000 employees in over 70 countries as of January 31, 2025. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie\'s
employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees.

the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund (a part of the AbbVie Foundation) supports two programs for global employees: the AbbVie Possibilities
Scholarship for children of employees, which is an annual merit-based scholarship for use at accredited colleges, universities or vocationaltechnical schools; and the Employee Relief Program, which is financial assistance to support short term needs of employees when faced with
large-scale disasters (e.g. a hurricane), individual disasters (e.g. a home fire) or financial hardship (e.g. the death of a spouse). Finally, AbbVie
empowers managers and their teams with tools, tips and guidelines on effectively managing workloads and managing teams from a distance.

New AbbVie employees are given a tailored onboarding experience for faster integration and to support performance. One of AbbVie\'s
mentorship programs allows employees to self-nominate as mentors or mentees and facilitates meaningful relationships supporting employees’
career and development goals.

AbbVie also provides structured, broad-based development opportunities, focusing on high-performance skills and leadership training.
AbbVie\'s talent philosophy holds leaders accountable for building a high-performing organization, and the company provides development
opportunities for all levels of leadership. AbbVie\'s Learn, Develop, Perform program offers year-long, self-directed leadership education,
supplemented with tools and resources, and leverages leaders as role models and teachers. In addition, a foundational success factor to AbbVie\'s
leadership pipeline is the company\'s Professional Development Programs, which attract graduates, postgraduates and post-doctoral talent to
participate in formal development programs lasting up to three years, with the objective of strengthening functional and leadership capabilities.

_Culture. AbbVie’s shared principles of transforming lives, acting with integrity, driving innovation, embracing diversity and inclusion, and_
serving the community form the core of the company\'s culture. AbbVie articulates the behaviors associated with these values in the Ways We
Work, a core set of working behaviors that emphasize how the company achieves results is equally as important as achieving them. The Ways
We Work are designed to ensure that every AbbVie employee is aware of the company\'s cultural expectations. AbbVie integrates the Ways We
Work into all talent processes, forming the basis for assessing performance, prioritizing development and ultimately rewarding employees.
AbbVie believes its culture creates strong engagement, which is measured regularly through a confidential, third-party all-employee survey, and
this engagement supports AbbVie’s mission of making a remarkable impact on people’s lives.

_Diversity & Inclusion. A cornerstone of AbbVie’s human capital management approach is to prioritize fostering an inclusive workforce_
where all employees have equal opportunity to succeed. AbbVie is committed to equal employment opportunity and non-discrimination in all
aspects of employment. Further, AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually. A critical component of AbbVie\'s
strategy is to instill an inclusive mindset in all AbbVie leaders and employees, so the company continues to realize the full value of its workforce
from recruitment through retirement. AbbVie\'s Employee Resource Groups also help the company nurture an inclusive culture by building
community and creating connections.
